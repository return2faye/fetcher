## What is this project?

**Fetcher** is a multi-agent system built with LangGraph. It takes complex technical or
data-analysis questions from a user, autonomously researches the web, generates code,
executes it in an isolated sandbox, and verifies the results before returning a final answer.

## Architecture (3 sentences)

A **Supervisor graph** decomposes the user query into a plan of typed sub-tasks (research,
code, hybrid) and routes each task to one of two sub-graphs. The **Corrective RAG (CRAG)
sub-graph** retrieves from a Qdrant vector DB, LLM-grades relevance, rewrites queries or
falls back to DuckDuckGo web search, then generates an answer. The **Code sub-graph**
(not yet built) will generate code, execute it in a Docker sandbox, and self-correct on
failure.

## Tech stack

| What            | Choice                                       |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Framework       | LangGraph (StateGraph, conditional edges)    |
| LLM             | OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` (fast) / `gpt-4o` (heavy) via `langchain-openai` |
| Embeddings      | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` via `sentence-transformers` (local, free) |
| Vector DB       | Qdrant (Docker container, port 6333)         |
| Web search      | `duckduckgo-search` (free, no API key)       |
| Code sandbox    | Docker container (Phase 4)                   |
| Checkpointer    | SQLite via `langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite`     |
| Python env      | Conda env named `fetcher`, Python 3.11       |

**Important constraints from user:**
- No Tavily API key — use DuckDuckGo for all web search
- No paid embedding APIs — use local sentence-transformers only
- OpenAI API key is available (the only paid external service)

|-------|----------------------------------|---------|
| 1     | Architecture design              | Done    |

| 6     | HITL, streaming & observability  | Pending |
| 7     | Hardening & polish               | Pending |

**16 tests, all passing.** Run with: `conda activate fetcher && PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/ -v`

## How the graphs work

### Supervisor flow
```
user query → intake_planner (LLM decomposes into [type] tasks)
  → router (reads plan[current_index], sets task_type)
    → rag_subgraph   (if research) → router (advance index)
    → code_subgraph  (if code)     → router (advance index)
    → hybrid         (if hybrid)   → router (advance index)
    → synthesizer    (if done — all tasks complete)
      → human_review (HITL gate, Phase 6)
        → finalize → END
```

### CRAG flow
```
query → retrieve (Qdrant top-5)
  → grade_documents (LLM scores each doc)
    → decide_action:
      - "relevant" (2+ good docs)    → generate → END
      - "ambiguous" (1 doc, retries left) → rewrite_query → retrieve (loop)
      - "irrelevant" (0 docs or retries exhausted) → web_search → generate → END
```

## What to do next (Phase 4)

Build the Code Generation & Verification sub-graph in this order:
1. Docker sandbox setup — a Python Docker image for isolated code execution
2. `coder` node — LLM generates code from task description + research context
3. `executor` node — run code in Docker, capture stdout/stderr/exit_code
4. `critic` node — LLM evaluates: is the output correct?
5. `error_handler` node — extract traceback, format feedback for retry
6. Wire the self-correction loop: coder → executor → critic → {END | error_handler → coder}
7. Tests for the full cycle

After Phase 4, Phase 5 wires both sub-graphs into the supervisor (replacing stubs).

## Container management

Use `./scripts/start.sh` and `./scripts/stop.sh` to manage Docker containers (Qdrant, and
later the code sandbox). See `docker/docker-compose.yml` for the full stack definition.

## Session workflow

The user expects incremental development across sessions. At the end of every session:
1. Update `project_architecture_and_plan.md` — check off completed items
2. Update `dev_log.md` — add a new session entry with what was done, decisions, next steps
3. Update `docs/design_rationale.md` — add a new section for every non-trivial design
   decision made during the session. Explain what you chose, what you rejected, and why.
   This is not optional. The user reads this to understand your thinking, and you read it
   to check whether past decisions still hold.
4. Commit with a descriptive message
5. All tests must pass before committing
